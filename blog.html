          <p>A lot of facility teams live by the motto “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Sounds simple, but waiting until something goes wrong can lead to a whole lot of headaches like extra costs, lost time, and unhappy people. Preventive maintenance, on the other hand, is like giving your building a regular tune-up so everything runs smoother, longer, and with way less drama.
